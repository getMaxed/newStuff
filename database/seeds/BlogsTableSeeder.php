The notorious frontman doesn\'t listen to a lot of metal these days, in fact. His hardcore, punk rock and hip hop listening habits surface on the quartet\'s latest effort. It goes without saying that Flynn has taken bold moves in his career. Whatever his motivations might have been for the more accessible sounds and stylistic shift on "Catharsis", the results aren\'t pretty.';

But here we are, five years later, and the band has officially released their fourth studio album In Becoming A Ghost (Sumerian).  When it comes to such highly anticipated releases that have taken years to come out, one fear immediately comes to mindâ€¦ Will it be any good after all this time?';
